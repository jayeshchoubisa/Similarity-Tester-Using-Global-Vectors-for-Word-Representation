# Similarity-Tester-Using-Global-Vectors-for-Word-Representation
# Overview:
#### This code will read and load vectors for the words for given sentences as per the input.It identifies cosine similarity using scipy's distance function.Average of vectors is taken and similarity is calculated.
# Dependencies:
#### 1. Scipy
#### 2. Numpy
#### 3. GloVe
### GloVe can be downloaded from here: https://nlp.stanford.edu/software/GloVe-1.2.zip
# Usage:
#### Run this using jupyter notebook.Just type jupyter notebook in the main directory and the code will pop up in a browser window.
# Output:
#### This code will give you silmilarity score among the sentence 1 and sentence 2.
